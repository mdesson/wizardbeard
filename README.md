# Wizardbeard
Manage Your 5e Spells Your Way. Never play a game again with dozens of browser tabs open. This is a labour of love: My goal is to try and make the website I wished existed when I started playing.

Accessible at: https://www.wizardbeard.xyz/ 

Without an account you can:

- Search for spells in your browser
- Use a variety of filters such as level, class, concentration, and more!

With an account you can:

- Create characters
- Add spells to your character
- Mark spells as known/prepared


## Technical Stuff

This is a React website that allows users to manage their D&D 5e spells quickly and conveniently. Data is sourced from a 5e SRD API. I'm using a managed backend in Firebase. There will (eventually) be a Golang refactor.

## Upcoming Features

Right now the project is at its most barebones. Upcoming features include:

- Homebrew spells
- Spells innate to specific races
- Spells innate to specific classes
- Spell slot management
- Management of prepared spells (ensuring a level 5 wizard has the right number of cantrips, for example)
- ... And more! 

## Requesting Features and Reporting Bugs

If you want to request features or found a bug, just shoot me an email at: mdesson@gmail.com

## Privacy

The only data stored on users besides any D&D charcter data is their email address for their user account and the name associated that account. To enhance security, I'm using "Log in With Google", and that is bare minimum I can get it to provide to me. 

If you wish you to delete your account, just send me an email and I'll delete all your data.
